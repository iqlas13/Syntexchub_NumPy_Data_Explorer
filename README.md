# Syntexchub_NumPy_Data_Explorer
Project 1: NumPy Data Explorer using a student dataset. Includes indexing, slicing, statistical analysis, reshaping, broadcasting, save/load, and performance comparison using NumPy.

# NumPy Data Explorer – Project 1

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of NumPy for exploring and analyzing a real
student performance dataset. It includes array creation, indexing, slicing,
statistical operations, reshaping, broadcasting, saving/loading arrays, and
performance comparison with Python lists.

## Dataset
Student performance dataset (CSV format)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy

## Features
- Indexing and slicing of NumPy arrays
- Mathematical and statistical analysis
- Reshaping and broadcasting
- Handling missing values (NaN)
- Save and load NumPy arrays
- Performance comparison between NumPy arrays and Python lists

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook file `NumPy_Student_Data_Explorer.ipynb`
2. Upload the dataset `student_data(project1).csv` if required
3. Run all cells
